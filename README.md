# autonomous-arm-object-detection
This machine vision project was done for a competition about autonomous pick-and-place arms that needed to pick up specific objects and place them in dedicated spots. The project involved a custom object detection model that can recognize 3 specific objects, a blue cube, a red prism and a yellow cylinder.

ShapeDetector.py: The main code file
ObjWithColorOnly.py: This file is for detecting the objects with their specific colors only
best.pt: Main custom model training data
version2.pt: Another version of the training data

The object videos can be found here for testing purposes: https://mega.nz/folder/kE4gXKKK#irZ1jECdLJ4MkBhBCzcUrw
